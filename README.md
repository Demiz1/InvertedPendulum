# InvertedPendulum
I want to further reasure myself that I still know how to model and controll systems.

This project aims to build a simple inverted pendulum that is controlled with a PID loop.

The simulaton may use the euler forward method or it can use the RK4 method.
RK4 have much higher performance but more involved to solve.

The controll loop can either use noisy measurements or the true state. Measurements are ofcourse more interesting, but also more involved. I do not want this project to become too involved, so the use of true state will probably be the way I go.
